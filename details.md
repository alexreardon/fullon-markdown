## About

### What is Full On?

Full On is a [St Philip’s Eastwood Anglican Church](http://en.stphils.org.au/) summer youth camp.
It is for youth who will be in Year 6-12 in 2020 and graduating Year 12s of 2019. Full On is a Christian camp where the students will learn from the Bible about who Jesus is, what he has done, and what it means to follow him. It is also a week of full on fun and activities, indoor and outdoors, in a loving community.

This year the theme for camp is ‘Pioneers’. We will be exploring the book of Acts, and seeing how to the ends of the Earth – Jesus changes everything. In Acts we see Jesus change individual’s lives and change communities as a result of the changed mission of his followers – to bring his good news to the ends of the Earth.

## Statement of Faith

Interested in our theology? We are! Feel free to contact us if you have any concerns or questions.

As Christians, we believe that all humans have rejected God and have decided to live our own way. The result is that we end up in eternal exile from God, with nothing we can do about it.

God, acting with love and grace, sent His son Jesus into the world to live the perfect life that we could not, and take the punishment for our sin by his death on the cross so that we can return into a relationship with Him.

This gives us two choices. We can either continue living the way we were, in rejection of God, and face the consequences for our actions, or we can turn and commit our lives to Jesus so that we can return to an eternal relationship with God . [More information](http://twowaystolive.com/)
